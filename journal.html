			<h2>TSL: Class 1</h2>
			<h3>Posted on 4/3/13 by Dave</h3>
			<p>
					Last night we had the first class for our beginner HTML/CSS class at <a href="http://starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a>.  I find learning in-person so much better than trying to learn online.  I’ve tried a number of the virtual “learn to code” sites have never gotten very far.  Even though all of <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe’s</a> lessons are online, he (and the rest of the instructors) add so much more through the lecture and discussions than could ever have come through just online.
					<br><br>
					We learned some of the basic terminology and syntax of HTML and CSS.  Even though I came into the class with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS, I found the first lesson incredibly fascinating..  The biggest takeaway for me was how complicated the relationship between your HTML and CSS could potentially get.  It seems like it will take an incredible amount of pre-planning (or lots of re-writing) to get your code to be super clean and efficient.  I tend to prefer pre-planning structures vs. adapting on the fly, so it will be interesting to see how I want to approach challenges in this paradigm.  
					<br><br>
					I liken it to my post-production editing workflow.  I look at early video projects when I was just learning and there was very little organization.  This often led to strange editing workflows and unnecessary fixes.  I then learned from some of the best Assistant Editors to keep projects neat and organized from the beginning.  Hopefully, knowing how important structure and organization can be to a project will help me in my HTML/CSS projects.
